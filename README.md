This is a couple of small projects I used to learn about LLMs and code generation. The projects are:

- `rust-safe` - the LLM-generated RRT-star planning module in 2D using Claude 3.5 Sonnet
- `ompl` - a utilization of the RRT-star planner implemented in the Open Motion Planning library

The LLM-generated planner has not been verified. A brief comparison of these two planners can be found on [my website](https://www.aerosota.com/blog/llm-rrt-star/).
